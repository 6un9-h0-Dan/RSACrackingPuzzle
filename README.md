# Understanding Common Factor Attacks:<br>An RSA-Cracking Puzzle .... solution :)

Hi,
<br>
this is my *"solution"*, coded for convenience in python, for the RSA Cracking Puzzle hosted here:
<br>
http://www.loyalty.org/~schoen/rsa/
<br>

Note for the author:
<br>
*"In the style of the Mystery Hunt and other contemporary puzzle hunts, the challenge eventually yields a specific answer that is a single word â€” but you'll have to figure out how to interpret the decrypted data to yield this word, since the RSA-decrypted data is itself in a non-RSA-related code. I'm not providing any specific instructions about what to do with the decrypted data beyond the fact that it can be interpreted as a reference to a single English word."*
<br>

So the real solution to the puzzle, that is the **single word in English**, is not included ;)

Happy cracking (please don't)
